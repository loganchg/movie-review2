The inspiration for the application.

We wanted to create a movie review application that people can leave a review for their favourite movies. In this application, people can read the story line for some movies and we also created some paths to different social media pages.

How to use the application.

In order to leave a review for your favorite movies, you can click on the review link on the home page. It will navigate you to the log in page. New User can also click on the "Log on" button on the top right column to sign up their account. Clicking the movies containers on the home page will bring you to the movies' individual page which contains their poster image and storyline. Under the poster, you will also find a leave review button to add your review to the movie page. If you scroll down to the footer section, you will also find the links that will link you to different social media websites. It will open a new tab so you can share your favorites with your friends.

Lists the technologies used to build the application.

These are the npm install packages that we use for this project bootstrap" "express" "nodemon" "react" "react-dom" "react-icons" "react-router-dom" "react-scripts"

MongoDB is the data base that we have been using for this project to store the data when user registers their account. We also use Mongodb to store the data for movie reviews,

Any outstanding bugs or unfinished functionality should be addressed before deployment.

It would be so much nicer if we could create individual movie trailers container where people can preview their favorite movies. or a faded video background would be nice to have. Setting up the IMDb API would also a good idea , especially we can obtain more informative materials. Overall, it is a nice experiences that we can combine what we have learnt in the past 8-9 months.
